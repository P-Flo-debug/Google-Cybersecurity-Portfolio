# 🌐 Course 3: Connect and Protect - Network Security

This folder documents my ability to analyze network traffic, troubleshoot protocol failures, defend against network attacks, and apply industry-standard frameworks like the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.

## 📑 Portfolio Artifacts
* **[NIST CSF Incident Report](./NIST-Incident-Report/README.md):** A professional analysis of an ICMP Flood DoS attack, mapping the response to the Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions.
* **[DNS Analysis & Incident Report](./Network-Traffic-Analysis/README.md):** A technical investigation using **tcpdump** to diagnose a DNS service failure and identify "Port Unreachable" errors.
* **[TCP SYN Flood Attack Analysis](./Network-Attack-Analysis/README.md):** Identifying and mitigating a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by analyzing the TCP three-way handshake.
* **[OS Hardening & Brute Force Investigation](./OS-Hardening-Lab/README.md):** Analyzing a web server compromise and recommending hardening controls like MFA and account lockout policies.
* **[Network Hardening Risk Assessment](./Network-Hardening-Assessment/README.md):** A strategic proposal to remediate vulnerabilities (default passwords, unconfigured firewalls) following a major data breach.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied
* **Network Defense & Hardening:** Mastering port filtering, firewall rule configuration, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) deployment.
* **Protocol Mastery:** Practical application and log analysis of **TCP/IP**, **DNS**, **HTTP**, **UDP**, and **ICMP**.
* **Traffic Analysis:** Using packet sniffers and tools like **tcpdump** to identify the root cause of service disruptions and security incidents.
* **Attack Lifecycle Identification:** Analyzing the mechanics of DoS, Brute Force, and Malware redirection from initial access to impact.
