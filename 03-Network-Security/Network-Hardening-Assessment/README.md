# Lab: Network Hardening & Risk Assessment

## 🎯 Incident Overview
I conducted a security risk assessment for a social media organization following a major data breach. I identified four critical vulnerabilities and proposed a multi-layered hardening strategy to protect customer data.

## 🔍 Identified Vulnerabilities
1. **Password Sharing:** Employees sharing credentials, leading to lack of accountability.
2. **Default Passwords:** Database admin password left at factory settings.
3. **Weak Firewalls:** No traffic filtering rules in place.
4. **No MFA:** Lack of multi-factor authentication for sensitive accounts.

## 🛠️ Hardening Recommendations
* **Access Control:** Implement a strict no-sharing password policy and enforce MFA.
* **Network Defense:** Configure firewall rules to filter ingress and egress traffic based on the Principle of Least Privilege.
* **Credential Management:** Rotate all default passwords immediately and set an update schedule.
